# python_crypto_encryption

In this Project I have taken the Sample Dataset and implemented the AES, DES, ECC and Blowfish Cryptographic Algorithm 
And using Python i had implemented the Encryption of Sample Dataset for each algo and 
Finally Calclate the Average time for each row in a Dataset for Encryption and 
Total time for the Encryption of Dataset.


here is How to run each algorithem by command 
" python <filename.py>
ex : python ecc.py

Datset :   amazon.csv

Cryptographic Algorithms : AES, DES, ECC and BLOWFISH
