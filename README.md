# python_crypto_encryption

In this Project I have taken the Sample Dataset and implemented the AES, DES, ECC and Blowfish Cryptographic Algorithm 
And using Python i had implemented the Encryption of Sample Dataset for each algo and 
Finally Calclate the Average time for each row in a Dataset for Encryption and 
Total time for the Encryption of Dataset. 


And i have stored the Encrypted data in a saparte file called  "encrypted_data.bin" which is a Binary format data

"private_key.pem" and "public_key.pem" are the public keys and private keys generated.


here is How to run each algorithem by command 
" python <filename.py>
ex : python ecc.py

Datset :   amazon.csv

Cryptographic Algorithms : AES, DES, ECC and BLOWFISH
